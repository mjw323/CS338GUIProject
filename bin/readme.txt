The basic implementation is in there. I'm also currently missing the saving and loading bit because functionality of saving lists, listmodels, and arrays to a single object is kinda difficult. Also some of the implementation for creating a diagram is there, however I couldn't get it to work fully, so all that's there is an example image in the pop up dialog which shows how it's supposed to work. 

To Run Program:
1) Type "make" to run the makefile
2) Type "java Main"
