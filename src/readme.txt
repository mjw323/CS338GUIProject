The Interactive Network Bible

This project was created for Drexel's Graphical User Interfaces class. The main idea of the project is to provide an easy way to document and design a public network for a very large amount of devices. Most software out there can either discover devices that are very complicated or provide incomplete information without diagraming how they're connected. This would allow for manual input of devices that would automatically create the diagram based on how the devices are connected to each other.

The basic implementation is in there. I'm currently missing the saving and loading bit because functionality of saving lists, listmodels, and arrays to a single object is confusing. Also some of the implementation for creating a diagram is there, however I couldn't get it to work fully, so all that's there is an example image in the pop up dialog which shows how it's supposed to work. 

To Run Program:
1) Type "make" to run the makefile
2) Type "java Main"
